# Base-Engine-1
This is version 1 of a backtesting engine I am developing. The desired result of this project is to build a backtesting environment that I can use for my future projects. Please let me know If you have any suggestions regarding the project. 

The idea is to first create this backtesting environment, and then use this engine as it is for any other projects. In this first version, I will simply develop a script that requires the user to manually enter the trading strategy that it tests. One day I hope to update the code so it can be applied as a program, which could allow for more simplicity and readability.

**Structure of the code**
1. Libraries
2. Stock data
3. Define a trading strategy
4. Define a market position function
5. Define a backtesting function

**Libraries used**
I will use numpy, pandas, and yfinance
